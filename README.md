2.Deposit Funds: Users can deposit funds into their account, updating their balance accordingly.
3.Withdraw Funds: Users can withdraw money from their account as long as the withdrawal amount does not exceed the current balance.
4.Account Balances: Users can check their account balance at any time.
5.Error Handling and Validation: Ensure that the system handles various errors such as insufficient balance, invalid input, or non-existing accounts during money transfers or withdrawals.
